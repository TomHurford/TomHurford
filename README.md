## About me

I am currently a Junior Software Developer at [Cervus Defence](https://www.cervusdefence.com/) where I am working on many of their current projects. I am going to be studying Computer Science MSci at Kings College London starting in September 2021. I developed a strong interest in programming and software development during my A-levels and my current year placement, and I am keen to explore a future career in the software industry. 

I participate in the GCHQ CyberStart Challenge which encompasses both defensive and offensive computing skills. This has improved my approach to problem-solving, independent learning and research into new topics of interest. Working on my A-Level project taught me about web development, back end and database design and business logic development. Recently I have started to learn to use Unity with a focus on procedural mesh generation.

In 2019 I successfully applied for, fundraised and participated in the British Exploring Societyâ€™s trip to the Indian Himalaya where I received the John Muir award for services to the environment. We worked with the Ice Stupa project in Ladakh which is helping local communities to protect their lifestyle, culture and resources from climate change.
