## About me

I am currently a first-year student at King's College London studying for a Masters in Computer Science. I have previously worked as a Junior Software Developer for [Cervus Defence](https://cervus.ai/) where I worked on many of their projects including bids for US Marine Corps contracts where we were chosen over Microsoft as part of the BAE team to provide wargame analytics. My year in industry was supported by the [EDT (Engineering Design Trust)](https://www.etrust.org.uk/) as part of their YINI Scheme. During my year out I learned many programming, project management, and self-management skills as I worked from home during the Lockdown. I am keen to continue my career in the Software Development industry after and during my degree.

I participate in the GCHQ CyberStart Challenge which encompasses both defensive and offensive computing skills. This has improved my approach to problem-solving, independent learning, and research into new topics of interest. Working on my A-Level project taught me about web development, back end, and database design, and business logic development. Recently I have started to learn to use Unity with a focus on procedural mesh generation.

In 2019 I successfully applied for, fundraised and participated in the British Exploring Societyâ€™s trip to the Indian Himalaya where I received the John Muir award for services to the environment. We worked with the Ice Stupa project in Ladakh which is helping local communities to protect their lifestyle, culture, and resources from climate change.
